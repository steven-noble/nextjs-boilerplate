# usePersistedState

`usePersistedState` provides a multi-instance, multi-tab/browser shared and persistent state.

## Usage

`use-persisted-state` is not a hook itself, but is a factory that accepts a storage `key` and an optional storage provider (default = `localStorage`) and returns a hook that you can use as a direct replacement for `useState`.
