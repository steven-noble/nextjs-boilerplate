# useScrolled

`useScrolled` is a custom React hook that determines whether the user has scrolled down the page. It's useful for building dynamic UI elements that react to scroll behavior, such as sticky headers, back-to-top buttons, or animations triggered on scroll.

## Parameters

This hook does not take any parameters.

## Return Value

`isScrolled` (boolean)
- `true` if the page is scrolled beyond a predefined threshold (e.g., 100px).
- `false` if the page is at the top.

## Best Practices

- Use this hook in components where scroll state directly impacts the UI.
- Combine with throttle or debounce for performance optimization if handling intensive scroll-based logic.

## Limitations

- The hook assumes it's used in a browser environment. Ensure you're checking for server-side rendering (SSR) when using it in universal apps like Next.js.

## Examples

### Basic Example

```
import useScrolled from '@lib/hooks/useScrolled'

const isScrolled = useScrolled()
```

### Component Example

```
import useScrolled from '@lib/hooks/useScrolled';

const MyComponent = () => {
    const isScrolled = useScrolled();

    return (
        <header className={isScrolled ? 'scrolled' : ''}>
            This header changes style on scroll.
        </header>
    );
};
```
