# usePrevious (WIP)

usePrevious stores the previous value of the value argument passed to it.

After each render, the useEffect sets the ref.current to the current value.

On the next render, the usePrevious hook will return the value that was set during the previous render.

```
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import usePrevious from './usePrevious'; // import the custom hook

const Counter = () => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    const previousCount = usePrevious(count);

    useEffect(() => {
        console.log(`Current count: ${count}, Previous count: ${previousCount}`);
    }, [count, previousCount]);

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Current Count: {count}</p>
            <p>Previous Count: {previousCount}</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
};

export default Counter;
```
