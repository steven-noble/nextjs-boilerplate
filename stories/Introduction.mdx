# Welcome to Our Component Library

Our Storybook component library provides a powerful environment for building and showcasing UI components in isolation from your app's business logic and data. This approach allows you to easily develop and test various UI states, ensuring robust and flexible designs.

Within this library, you can save and revisit different UI states as stories, which serve as valuable references during development, testing, and QA processes.
We advocate for a [**component-driven**](https://componentdriven.org) development approach, where you start by creating atomic components and gradually assemble them into full pages. This method not only promotes reusability but also enhances the overall quality and consistency of your UI.

## Components

The foundational elements of our user interface, designed to be reusable and adaptable across various applications.

## Developers

A dedicated section providing documentation on functions and services that facilitate development within our ecosystem.

## Design System

Comprehensive guidelines that define the rules for colors, spacing, typography, and element shapes to ensure cohesive visual design.

## Assets

Access downloadable resources such as site logos, fonts, and other specific assets necessary for your projects.

## Hooks

A collection of reusable React.js hooks that streamline state management and side effects within your components.

## Pages

Mockups of complete pages that illustrate how groups of components work together, allowing for thorough testing of interactions and layouts.
