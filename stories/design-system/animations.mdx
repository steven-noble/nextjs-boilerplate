# Animations

Animations are applied as CSS classes to elements.

## Usage

The class of the animation you want to use should be added to the element by default.
The class `a-animate` should be added to the element when you want the class to
run, either immediately or when the element scrolls into the viewport
(See [Animate on Scroll](#animate-on-scroll)).

## Available animations

`.fade-in-up`

`.fade-in-down`

## Animate on scroll

For how to activate or persist an animation on scroll, see the
[useIntersectionObserver hook](/story/hooks-useintersectionobserver--page)
